## About Crusade Sports Medicine

Visit my [Crusade Sports Medicine, Non-Profit Organization & Research Journal](https://www.crusadezone.com/) to see my work on researching sports medicine and developing a program to educate student-athlete's on how hit target performance goals based on our science-based meta analysis and clinical research.

I co-founded crusade to cultivate a community of undergraduate student-athletes who are passionate about researching innovation in the sports medicine field, as well as educating other student-athletes on taking their performance to the next level.
