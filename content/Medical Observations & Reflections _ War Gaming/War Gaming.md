<h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction & Personal Statement</h1>

Rare moments... they are always the ones that reveal what you are truly passionate about. Whether it is your first time surfing, first time scoring a professional hockey goal, first meaningful relationship, first time shadowing a surgeon... first time interactiong with a sweet patient that is hiding fear inside before her surgery. As I began to recognize these rare moments in the operating room more and more, the more I felt a purpose. I began obsessing over how it is possible for a human to do the impossible, to do God's work in healing another human. It is the most selfless thing a person can do in their lifetime. And the more I obsessed with the science, the more I fell in love with circuitry. 

From my studies, my favorite word became "topology". It describes how individual elements (like resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.) connect and perform within a circuit—focusing on the structure or network of connections. I am an electrical engineer at heart; I love solving problems with current flowing through conductive wires and being able to redesign a network to a desired signal. Fixing the dielectric material in a capacitor, untangling wires to get a clearer signal to the main source, constructing a mechanical structure to support my repairs and enhance my product's performance.

Throughout my studies, lab research, and personal engineering projects, I began visualizing a shift in my perspective to the human body. **Neurons** (nerve cells) as the “circuit elements,” and **synapses** (the connections between neurons) as the “links” or “branches” in a network. This was the topology I wanted to study. Like Dr. Guerrero performing a complex surgery on the network of sensitive nerves with complex signals, my goal is to not only be able to help patients recover optimally, but to be in the center of applying and researching the newest technology to improve patient outcomes and advance the medical community.
