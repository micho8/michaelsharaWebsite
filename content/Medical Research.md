# Medical Research

## Overview

Through my Orthopedic Surgery Shadowing, I have been shadowing in the operating room and clinic. While shadowing in the Operating room, I prepare with thorough literature reviews on every surgical case to understand biomechanical principles, and biological structures for the respective cases. Before surgeries, I also observe preoperative imaging and nerve blocking techniques with the anesthesiologist.

## Research Areas

### Clinical Observations
- **Orthopedic Surgery Shadowing**: Operating room and clinic experiences
- **Surgical Case Studies**: Literature reviews and biomechanical analysis
- **Preoperative Imaging**: Understanding diagnostic techniques
- **Anesthesiology**: Nerve blocking and pain management

### Sports Medicine Research
- **Athletic Performance**: Optimizing training and recovery
- **Injury Prevention**: Biomechanical analysis and prevention strategies
- **Rehabilitation Protocols**: Evidence-based recovery methods

## Publications and Studies

### Medical Observations and Research

### Research Studies
- [[Clavicle Fracture ORIF]] - Detailed study on clavicle fracture treatment

### Organized by Date
[[z_By Date]] - Chronological organization of all medical observations

## Research Methodology

My approach to medical research involves:

1. **Literature Review**: Thorough analysis of existing research
2. **Clinical Observation**: Direct observation in medical settings
3. **Data Analysis**: Systematic review of findings
4. **Documentation**: Detailed recording of observations and insights

## Key Findings

Through my research, I've developed insights into:

- **Biomechanical Principles**: Understanding of musculoskeletal mechanics
- **Surgical Techniques**: Modern approaches to orthopedic procedures
- **Patient Care**: Holistic approaches to treatment and recovery
- **Sports Medicine Integration**: Bridging clinical practice with athletic performance

## Future Research Directions

I plan to continue research in:

- **Tissue Engineering**: Biomaterials for medical applications
- **Diagnostic Technologies**: Developing accessible testing platforms
- **Surgical Innovation**: New approaches to orthopedic procedures
- **Athletic Medicine**: Performance optimization and injury prevention
